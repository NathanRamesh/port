              <h2>Cultural Mask</h2>
              <h4>Grade 6</h4>
              <p>The grade 6 students developed a mask with cultural identities. They researched Indian and African masks and their usage of it in different cultural contexts. Based on the research, they produced a lot of initial sketches to understand the elements of art. Later they created a draft sketch based on both the cultures with their self-interpretation. The draft sketch was developed as a three-dimensional mask using various sculptural materials executed with fine craftsmanship. Students added their commentary on the strengths and challenges at the end of the portfolio. </p>
              <p>The complete portfolio covers all four IB Art criteria with strands, and it is considered their unit portfolio for grading. </p>
